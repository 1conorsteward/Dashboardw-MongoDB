# Dashboardw-MongoDB
A dashboard that shows animal shelter dogs based on certain rescue compatibility criteria. Shows a table, a pie chart, and a map with location.

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable consists of a few good habits. First, making your code modularized is essential for maintience and adaptablility. Readablility relies on good indenting, sticking to predeterminded and consistent coding layouts and essential commenting. Commenting code is esspecially important for maintainability and readability. Otherwise anyone coming in, including myself, will inevitably encounter difficulty when trying to decipher the code.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  The first step is requiremtns gathering. Being sure to have requiremtns down in a document that clearly outlines the needs, functions, and requiremetns of the project will be vital for designing and creating the software. From the requirements gathering step you should next create UML class diagrams to ensure that all neccessary functionality can be built into the program. If you need further design from there, documentatoin outlying the DB and front end connection can be vital. Creating DB's from the terminal worked well, but I would like to try building a SQLite DB within an application itself. I think this method can be very useful for smaller datastructures without the need for many thousands of lines of DB. Authenticating using the application was very useful and that is something I will be utilizing in the future.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist(CS) design and analyze algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently. Algorithms are the backbone of all computer applications, from search engines to data encryption, and they determine the speed and efficiency of software. They also develop and maintain software systems, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and efficient. High-quality software is essential for a wide range of applications, from healthcare to finance, ensuring that critical operations run smoothly. CS also develop methods to protect data and systems from cyber attacks and unauthorized access. As society becomes increasingly digital, safeguarding sensitive information and critical infrastructure is vital to maintaining trust and security. Analyzing large datasets to extract insights and support decision-making is also part of the CS world. Data-driven decisions lead to more effective strategies in all aspects of society. Cs also study and improve the ways people interact with computers and design user-friendly interfaces. Good design makes technology more accessible and easier to use, enhancing productivity and user satisfaction. Designing and managing networks and distributed systems that connect computers and devices is vital to the world. Reliable networks are essential for communication, commerce, and information sharing in today's interconnected world. On top of the above, technology is a major driver of economic growth, creating new markets and improving growth. Overall the use of CS is vital for our growing world. Everything from efficiently managing data, accessing vital information, creating software with great usecases, and managing business needs to much more. As long as the sky doesn't fall CS will continue to drive the world forward.
